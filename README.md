# Blackjack Strategy Trainer

This Blackjack strategy trainer is an interactive tool built with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, designed to help players practice and master basic Blackjack strategy under typical casino rules:

Dealer stands on soft 17
Doubling down after splits is allowed
Late surrender option available
Game is played with 4-8 decks
Blackjack payout is 3:2
With these rules and perfect basic strategy adherence, the estimated house edge typically ranges from around 0.4% to 0.6%. This implies an expected return to the player of about 99.4% to 99.6%.

To further enhance your edge, the trainer also introduces the concept of Expected Value (EV) counting. EV counting, a nuanced form of card counting, helps in making more informed decisions by quantifying the profitability of playing hands based on the composition of the remaining cards in the deck(s). Adjusting bets and strategies according to the EV (positive for favorable cards, negative for unfavorable ones) can potentially tilt the odds in the player's favor, further reducing the house edge when applied with skill.
